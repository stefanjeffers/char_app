      correct spreadsheet for three errors: (two formulas had commas, change field name to "subindex")

DONE: add migration to put ord in formulas table.

      update pinname and formula forms to include ord (and update tests).

DONE: change formula page layout to transpose rows and columns

      check tests for that.

      need to reload the formula data, since we have added the ord column.
