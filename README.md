# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Chinese character application

This is the char app based on:
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).


Notes: 

Edited ~/projects/ror/char_app/config/environments/development.rb
    to fix problem: "ERROR NoMethodError: undefined method `debug_rjs=' for ActionView::Base:Class..."

Downloaded git repo for sass-twitter-bootstrap, just to get a (compiled) bootstrap.css file.
Should clean that up before pushing to git.
Probably should just delete the sass-twitter-bootstrap tree, or move it outside of the project.
Note: after got file, had the problem that either the require, or the import needed the ".css" extension.
