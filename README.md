# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Chinese character application

This is the char app based on:
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).


Notes: 

Edited ~/projects/ror/char_app/config/environments/development.rb
    to fix problem: "ERROR NoMethodError: undefined method `debug_rjs=' for ActionView::Base:Class..."
