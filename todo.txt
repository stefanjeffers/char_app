DONE:	add migration to put ord in formulas table.

DONE:	update pinname and formula forms to include ord

	(update tests).

DONE:   change formula page layout to transpose rows and columns

	check tests for that (now doesn't seem to matter).

DONE:   need to reload the formula data, since we have added the ord column.

DONE:   No: must first recreate it and sort/uniq it (without ord col).
DONE:   And add or restore graph_id column (substitute '0' for '_'?)

DONE:   want to keep the graph_id column in both pinnames and formulas.

	add tests for that.

DONE:   prepare a file with both pinnames and formulas, so "un-uniq-ed".

DONE:   Maybe go back to spreadsheet version, and add a separate ord col for both pinnames and formulas, and maybe others?

        correct spreadsheet for errors: two formulas had commas
DONE:   correct spreadsheet for errors: change field name to "subindex"

N/A:	Must fill in ids in link table. How?
	No: remember algo:
DONE:	output ids and ords from pinnames join formulas,
DONE:	create alternate superset link table.
	(but, NB, we used rake db:seeds on pinnames alone, and got ID offset.
	Must repeat with whole reset to get the ID's set correctly,
		before fill in link table.
	Then, must winnow down to match true links.
