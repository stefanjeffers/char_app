Determined that form_for arg must be an object of type given by the controller where it is defined, etc.

Algo to seed relationship table between pinnames and formulas:

1. do join of pinnames and formulas for each base/offset/subindex combo. Ie, for each graph_id.
(want to add graph_id to formula table?)

2. write a ruby script to loop through all of these.

3. create a relationship entry for each combo of id from pinname and formula.
   (length of resulting table should be about the number of lines in the spreadsheet).

4. later, go through and delete false relationships (about 2 hours per second per entry.)

Better if we can use existing ord values:
    (But if we want to map to the table ID's, need to use DB, ie, joins?)

0.  Think about 2D nature of pinname X formula pairs.
00. Think about defining two separate "ord" fields:
       One for multiple pinnames per graph_id, and one for multiple formulas per graph_id.
       (and how to use, eg, uniq, sort, to find and fix them.)

1. Go through original spreadsheet (or CSV output):

2. Register each ord value, versus pinyin/name combo's (or base/offset/subindex combos?).

3. Create a relationship entry for each if appropriate.

4. May need to create an intermediate version using graph_id or equiv, and the two ord values,
   Then do a select for each of those and set the id's. (could use SQL sub-select, etc?)

Alt:

1. Make uniq-ed pinname list (only relevant fields)
2. Make uniq-ed formula list (only relevant fields)
3. Make un-uniq-ed list with both pinname and formula (relevant fields).
4. Write script:
     a. for each combo of base/offset/subindex do
            for each entry in pinname list
                 for each entry in formula list,
                        if there is a corresponding line in un-uniq-ed list (ie, this pinname/formula combo)
                                write a record (graph_id or equiv and the two uniq-ed ord values).
